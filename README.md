systemInfo
==========

A cross-platform header file to get hardware information about a computer.

How to use
==========
Include the file in one of your project files, and call any of the functions!
The functions will return a std::string of the info. Up to you how you then want to format it.

Progress
========
Linux info is pretty much done.
Windows info is partially done.
OSX hasn't been started, as I don't have an OSX machine to test on.
